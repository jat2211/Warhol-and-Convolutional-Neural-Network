# Warhol-and-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project extracts the style from a paintings by Andy Warhol. The work is still in the preliminary phase. I anticipate the completion of this project in February 2022. Immediately following this work, I will take a series of paintings from Andy Warhol and create a generative model using NVIDIA's StyleGAN2. I want to create a looping video that "predicts" a painting to create an abstraction of machine thought of a concept.
